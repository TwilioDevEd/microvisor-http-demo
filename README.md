# Microvisor HTTP Demo 1.0.1

This repo provides a basic demonstration of a user application capable of working with Microvisor’s HTTP communications system calls.

It is based on the [FreeRTOS](https://freertos.org/) real-time operating system and which will run on the “non-secure” side of Microvisor. FreeRTOS is included as a submodule.

The application code files can be found in the [app_src/](app_src/) directory. The [ST_Code/](ST_Code/) directory contains required components that are not part of Twilio Microvisor STM32U5 HAL, which this sample accesses as a submodule. The `FreeRTOSConfig.h` and `stm32u5xx_hal_conf.h` configuration files are located in the [config/](config/) directory.

## Actions

The code creates and runs two threads under FreeRTOS.

One thread periodically toggles GPIO A5, which is the user LED on the [Microvisor Nucleo Development Board](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iot/microvisor/microvisor-nucleo-development-board).

The second thread It also emits a “ping” to the Microvisor logger once a second. Every 60 seconds it makes a `GET` request to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`, a free API the delivers an object JSON testing.

## Cloning the Repo

This repo makes uses of git submodules, some of which are nested within other submodules. To clone the repo, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/microvisor-http-demo.git
```

and then:

```bash
cd microvisor-http-demo
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Requirements

You will need a Twilio account. [Sign up now if you don’t have one](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).

You will also need a Twilio Microvisor Nucleo Development Board. These are currently only available to Private Beta program participants.

## Software Setup

This project is written in C. At this time, we only support Ubuntu 20.0.4. Users of other operating systems should build the code under a virtual machine running Ubuntu.

**Note** macOS users may attempt to install the pre-requisites below using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). This is not supported, but should work. You may need to change the names of a few of the packages listed in the `apt install` command below.

### Libraries and Tools

Under Ubuntu, run the following:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi git \
                 python3 python3-pip build-essential protobuf-compiler \
                 cmake libsecret-1-dev curl jq
```

Now run:

```bash
pip3 install cryptography protobuf
```

### Twilio CLI

Install the Twilio CLI (required to view streamed logs):

```bash
curl -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
```

Close your terminal window or tab, and open a new one. Now run:

```bash
nvm install --lts
npm install twilio-cli -g
twilio plugins:install @twilio/plugin-microvisor
```

Running the Twilio CLI and the project's [deploy script](./deploy.sh) — for uploading the built code to the Twilio cloud and subsequent deployment to your Microvisor Nucleo Board — uses the following Twilio credentials stored as environment variables. They should be added to your shell profile:

```bash
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export TWILIO_API_KEY=SKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export TWILIO_API_SECRET=YKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export MV_DEVICE_SID=UVxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You can get the first two from your Twilio Console [account dashboard](https://console.twilio.com/).

To generate API keys and secrets, visit [**Account > API keys & tokens**](https://twilio.com/console/project/api-keys/).

Restart your terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
curl https://microvisor.twilio.com/v1/Devices \
  -u ${TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID}:${TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN} -s | jq
```

This will yield JSON which contains a `device` array — your Microvisor Nucleo Board will be in that array. Use the value of its `sid` field for your `MV_DEVICE_SID` value.

## Build the Code

Build the sample code in the repo directory with:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/
cmake --build build --clean-first
```

## Deploy the Application

Run:

```bash
./deploy.sh --log
```

This will upload the build and stage it for deployment to your device. If you encounter errors, please check your stored Twilio credentials.

The `--log` flag initiates log-streaming.

## View Log Output

You can start log streaming separately — for example, in a second terminal window — with this command:

```bash
twilio microvisor:logs:stream ${MV_DEVICE_SID}
```
